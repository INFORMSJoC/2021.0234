In particular, our algorithm determines the contour as a combination of the current edge map and the contour, predicted from the tracking result in the previous frame. Using the concept of topographical distance, the watershed segmentation can be formulated as a minimization. We also show that the problem of background clutter can be relaxed by taking the object motion into account. The inverted distance transform of the edge map is used as an edge indicator function for contour detection. The experimental results confirm the expected advantages of the proposed method over the existing approaches This new viewpoint gives a way
