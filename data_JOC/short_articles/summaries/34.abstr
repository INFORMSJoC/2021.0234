The approach can be easily generalized to design multivariable coupled and decentralized PID loops and has been successfully validated for a large number of experimental cases The designer has to adjust the parameters of the PID controller such that the feedback interconnection of the plant and the controller satisfies the specifications. An approach for adjusting the parameters of a PID controller based on multiobjective optimization and genetic algorithms is presented in this paper. Design of PID-type controllers using multiobjective genetic algorithms The design of a PID controller is a multiobjective problem. A plant and a set of specifications to be
