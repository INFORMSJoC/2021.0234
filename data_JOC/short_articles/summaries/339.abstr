An automated parallel image registration technique based on the correlation of wavelet features With the increasing importance of multiple multiplatform remote sensing missions, fast and automatic integration of digital data from disparate sources has become critical to the success of these endeavors. Our wavelet-based registration algorithm is tested successfully with data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM), which differ by translation and/or rotation. By the choice of high-frequency wavelet features, this method is similar to an edge-based correlation method, but by exploiting the multiresolution nature of
