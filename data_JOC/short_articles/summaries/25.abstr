The adaptive nature of these evolving rule-based models, in combination with the highly transparent and compact form of fuzzy rules, makes them a promising candidate for modeling and control of complex processes, competitive to neural networks. The approach has been tested on a benchmark problem and on an air-conditioning component modeling application using data from an installation serving a real building. eR models implement a method for the noniterative update of both the rule-base structure and parameters by incremental unsupervised learning. Identification of evolving fuzzy rule-based models An approach to identification of evolving fuzzy rule-based (eR) models is proposed. In
