Feedforward maximum power point tracking of PV systems using fuzzy controller A feedforward maximum power (MP) point tracking scheme is developed for the interleaved dual boost (IDB) converter fed photovoltaic (PV) system using fuzzy controller. The proposed fuzzy feedforward peak power tracking effectiveness is demonstrated through the simulation and experimental results, and compared with the conventional proportional plus integral (PI) controller based system. The tracking algorithm changes the duty ratio of the converter such that the solar cell array (SCA) voltage equals the voltage corresponding to the MP point at that solar insolation. Finally, a comparative study of interleaved boost
