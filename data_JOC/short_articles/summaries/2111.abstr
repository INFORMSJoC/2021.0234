In this report we describe the development of algorithms, specifically adapted for imaging chlorophyll fluorescence and photosynthetic function in living plant cells, which allow extended-focus images to be reconstructed from images taken in different focal planes. Extended depth-of-focus imaging of chlorophyll fluorescence from intact leaves Imaging dynamic changes in chlorophyll a fluorescence provides a valuable means with which to examine localised changes in photosynthetic function. However, such systems have a restricted depth of focus and, as leaves are inherently uneven, only a small proportion of each image at any given focal plane is in focus. We describe how these procedures
