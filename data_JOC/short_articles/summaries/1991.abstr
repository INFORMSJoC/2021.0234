Capacity is determined by the statistical model used for the host image, by the distortion constraints on the data hider and the attacker, and by the information available to the data hider, to the attacker, and to the decoder. We consider autoregressive, block-DCT, and wavelet statistical models for images and compute data-hiding capacity for compressed and uncompressed host-image sources. A framework for evaluating the data-hiding capacity of image sources An information-theoretic model for image watermarking and data hiding is presented in this paper. Closed-form expressions are obtained under sparse-model approximations. Previous theoretical results are used to characterize the fundamental capacity
