Discrete output feedback sliding mode control of second order systems - a moving switching line approach The sliding mode control systems (SMCS) for which the switching variable is designed independent of the initial conditions are known to be sensitive to parameter variations and extraneous disturbances during the reaching phase. For second order systems this drawback is eliminated by using the moving switching line technique where the switching line is initially designed to pass the initial conditions and is subsequently moved towards a predetermined switching line. Simulation results show that the fast output sampling feedback guarantees sliding motion similar to that
