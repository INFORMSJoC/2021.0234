A new graphical user interface for fast construction of computation phantoms and MCNP calculations: application to calibration of in vivo measurement systems Reports on a new utility for development of computational phantoms for Monte Carlo calculations and data analysis for in vivo measurements of radionuclides deposited in tissues. The individual properties of each worker can be acquired for a rather precise geometric representation of his (her) anatomy, which is particularly important for low energy gamma ray emitting sources such as thorium, uranium, plutonium and other actinides. The utility includes segmentation of images obtained with either computed tomography or magnetic resonance
