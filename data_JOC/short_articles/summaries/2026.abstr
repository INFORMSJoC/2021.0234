The novelty of the proposed algorithm is that no knowledge of the noise distribution is required, and the relative contributions of the LMS, the LMF, and the smoothing functionals are adjusted based on the partially restored image. Two regularization parameters are introduced: one to determine the relative importance of the LMS and LMF functionals, which is a function of the kurtosis, and another to determine the relative importance of the smoothing functional. Iterative regularized least-mean mixed-norm image restoration We develop a regularized mixed-norm image restoration algorithm to deal with various types of noise. A mixed-norm functional is introduced, which combines
