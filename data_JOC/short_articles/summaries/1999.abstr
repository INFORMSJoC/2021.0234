Performance comparison between PID and dead-time compensating controllers This paper is intended to answer the question: "When can a simple dead-time compensator be expected to perform better than a PID?". Here, as a measure of robustness, the H/sub infinity / norm of the sum of the absolute values of the sensitivity function and the complementary sensitivity function is used. It is compared for PI and PID controllers and a simple dead-time compensator (DTC) when a step load disturbance is applied at the plant input. Both stable and integrating processes are considered. Performance of the DTC's is given also as a
