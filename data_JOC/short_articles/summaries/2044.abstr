The program uses an "image tree" data structure to construct the images needed to compute all the rays carrying fields above a preset "threshold" value, no matter how many reflections are needed. Three-dimensional geometrical optics code for indoor propagation This paper presents a program, GO 3D, for computing the fields of a transmitter in an indoor environment using geometrical optics. A case study consisting of a long corridor with a small room on one side is used to demonstrate the features of the GO 3D program The paper briefly describes the input file required to define wall construction, the floor
