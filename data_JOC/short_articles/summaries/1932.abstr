There are three possible variants defined by the numbers m and n evenness, with only one of them having a solution. In two other cases, correction of the initial state of the safe insuring a solution is proposed It is reduced to a system of linear equations in the modulo 2 residue class. Solution of the safe problem on (0,1)-matrices A safe problem with mn locks is studied.
