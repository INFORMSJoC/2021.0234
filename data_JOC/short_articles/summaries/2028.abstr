The first method is based on the modulus of the moment function, the second method is based on squaring the moment function, and the third method works with a single intensity filter. Centroid detection based on optical correlation We propose three correlation-based methods to simultaneously detect the centroids of multiple objects in an input scene. We present results showing simulations from different approaches and provide comparisons between optical-correlation- and digital-moment-based methods. We use spatial light modulators (SLMs) to directly implement the input of the image and filter information for the purpose of these approaches. These methods are invariant to changes
