Note on "Deterministic inventory lot-size models under inflation with shortages and deterioration for fluctuating demand" by Yang et al For original paper see H.-L. Yang et al., ibid., vol.48, p.144-58 (2001). The present paper provides examples, which show that the optimal replenishment schedule and consequently the overall optimal policy may not exist Yang et al. For this model they proved that the optimal replenishment schedule exists and is unique. extended the lot-size models to allow for inflation and fluctuating demand. They also proposed an algorithm to find the optimal policy.
