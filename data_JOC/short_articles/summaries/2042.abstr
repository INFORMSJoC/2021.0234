The article concludes with a survey of literature on hybrid simulation of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in finite-size objects: jets moving across the magnetic field in the middle of the field reversal layer; interaction between a magnetized plasma flow and a cylindrical plasma source with zero own magnetic field We start with a brief review of the theory: the simplest model of the instability - a transition layer in the form of a tangential discontinuity; compressibility of the medium; finite size of the velocity shear region; pressure anisotropy. We review the studies on two-dimensional and three-dimensional hybrid simulation of the process
