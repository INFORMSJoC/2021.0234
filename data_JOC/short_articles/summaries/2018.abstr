Design and implementation of a 3-D mapping system for highly irregular shaped objects with application to semiconductor manufacturing The basic technology for a robotic system is developed to automate the packing of polycrystalline silicon nuggets into fragile fused silica crucible in Czochralski (melt pulling) semiconductor wafer production. The key contribution is to describe the design and implementation of an efficient and robust 3-D imaging system to map highly irregular shaped objects using conventional components in context of real commercial manufacturing processes For this application, a dual optical 3-D surface mapping system that uses active laser triangulation has been developed and
