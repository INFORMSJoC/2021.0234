Improving the predicting power of partial order based QSARs through linear extensions Partial order theory (POT) is an attractive and operationally simple method that allows ordering of compounds, based on selected structural and/or electronic descriptors (modeled order), or based on their end points, e.g., solubility (experimental order). The study show that partial ordering combined with linear extensions appears as a promising tool providing probability distribution curves in the range of possible end-point values for compounds not being experimentally investigated If the modeled order resembles the experimental order, compounds that are not experimentally investigated can be assigned a position in the
