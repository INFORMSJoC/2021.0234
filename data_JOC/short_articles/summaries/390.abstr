The ANN/sub insp/ and ANN/sub expi/ correctly determine respectively 98.0% and 98.7% of the desired windows, when compared with 29 820 inspirations and 29 819 expirations detected by a human expert, obtained from three entire-night recordings. Automated breath detection on long-duration signals using feedforward backpropagation artificial neural networks A new breath-detection algorithm is presented, intended to automate the analysis of respiratory data acquired during sleep. A comparison with two previously published algorithms for breath detection in respiratory volume signal shows that the presented algorithm has a higher specificity, while presenting similar or higher positive predictive values The algorithm is based
