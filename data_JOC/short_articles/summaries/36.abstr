When characteristics of the system are examined, it becomes clear that a commonly used proportional plus integral plus derivative (PID) controller cannot meet such performance specifications for this kind of system. Often, strict closed-loop performance requirements (such as fast startup with no overshoot and maintaining tight temperature control during production) are given for such applications. In order to achieve the required performance, a control strategy that utilizes techniques such as model predictive control, autotuning, and multiple parameter PID is formulated. Model predictive control helps to regulate slow processes-robust barrel temperature control Slow temperature control is a challenging control problem. The
