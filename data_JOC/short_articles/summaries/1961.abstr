Various types of toll collection are examined, which can be characterized either by a waiting time or a reduced speed. The phase separation results a saturated flow, which is observed as a plateau region in the fundamental diagram. The influence of tollbooths on highway traffic We study the effects of tollbooths on the traffic flow. Besides the numerical results, we also obtain analytical expressions for various quantities. The differences between long- and short-distance travelers are also discussed The numerical simulations can be well described by the analytical formulas. The highway traffic is simulated by the Nagel-Schreckenberg model. A first-order phase
