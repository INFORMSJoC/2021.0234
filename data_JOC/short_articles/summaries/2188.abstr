After deriving the analytical description of the relationship between the variable admittance and active power flows of each generator, the traditional generator dynamic equations can thus be expressed with the variable admittance of HVDC systems as an additional state variable and changed to an affine form, which is suitable for global linearization method being used to determine its control variable. The design procedure is tested on a dual-infeed hybrid AC/DC system A nonlinear modulation strategy for hybrid AC/DC power systems A nonlinear control strategy to improve transient stability of a multi-machine AC power system with several DC links terminated in
