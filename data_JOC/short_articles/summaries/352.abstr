An efficient retrieval selection algorithm for video servers with random duplicated assignment storage technique Random duplicated assignment (RDA) is an approach in which video data is stored by assigning a number of copies of each data block to different, randomly chosen disks. This algorithm is based on the breadth-first search approach and is able to guarantee optimal solutions for RSP in O(n/sup 2/+mn), where m and n correspond to the number of data blocks and the number of disks, respectively. It has been shown that this approach results in smaller response times and lower disk and RAM costs compared to
