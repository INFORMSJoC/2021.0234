The particular application we have in mind is high-resolution ECG analysis, such as late potential analysis, morphology changes in QRS during arrythmias, T-wave alternants, or the study of drug effects on ventricular activation. The use of the SPSA method in ECG analysis The classification, monitoring, and compression of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals recorded of a single patient over a relatively long period of time is considered. The novelty of our approach is that we use a new distortion measure to quantify the distance of two ECG cycles, and the class-distortion measure is defined using a min-max criterion. The resulting nonsmooth optimization
