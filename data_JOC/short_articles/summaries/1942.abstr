Precoded OFDM with adaptive vector channel allocation for scalable video transmission over frequency-selective fading channels Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) has been applied in broadband wireline and wireless systems for high data rate transmission where severe intersymbol interference (ISI) always occurs. We propose to enhance the precoded OFDM system with adaptive vector channel allocation to provide stronger protection against errors to more important layers in the layered bit stream structure of scalable video. Previously, a new OFDM framework, the precoded OFDM, has been proposed to mitigate the above two problems through precoding and conversion of an ISI channel into ISI-free
