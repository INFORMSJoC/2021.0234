Design and implementation of a brain-computer interface with high transfer rates This paper presents a brain-computer interface (BCI) that can help users to input phone numbers. The attractive features of the system are noninvasive signal recording, little training required for use, and high information transfer rate. The buttons constituted a virtual telephone keypad, representing the ten digits 0-9, BACKSPACE, and ENTER. Eight of the thirteen subjects succeeded in ringing the mobile phone using the system. Twelve buttons illuminated at different rates were displayed on a computer monitor. The frequency-coded SSVEP was used to judge which button the user desired. Approaches
