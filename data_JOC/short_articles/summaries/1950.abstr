General solution of a density functionally gradient piezoelectric cantilever and its applications We have used the plane strain theory of transversely isotropic bodies to study a piezoelectric cantilever. Furthermore, as applications of this general solution in engineering, we have studied the tip deflection and blocking force of a piezoelectric cantilever actuator. the Airy stress function method). We have obtained the stress and induction functions in the form of polynomials as well as the general solution of the beam. Finally, we have addressed a method to determine the density distribution profile for a given piezoelectric material In order to find the
