Support structure, a major issue in machining-based systems which has seldom been addressed in previous research, is investigated in the paper with considerations of four situations: floating overhang, cantilever, vaulted overhang and ceiling. Layer-based machining: recent development and support structure design There is growing interest in additive and subtractive shaping theories that are synthesized to integrate the layered manufacturing process and material removal process. In the paper, major layer-based machining systems are reviewed and compared according to characteristics of stock layers, numerical control machining configurations, stacking operations, input format and raw materials. Except for the floating overhang where a support
