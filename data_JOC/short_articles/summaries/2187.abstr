Variable structure intelligent control for PM synchronous servo motor drive The variable structure control (VSC) of discrete time systems based on intelligent control is presented in this paper. Practical operating results from a PM synchronous motor (PMSM) illustrate the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed approach The parameter of the VSC scheme is adjusted online by a neural network. A linear observer is firstly designed. A novel approach is proposed for the state estimation. Then a neural network is used for compensating uncertainty.
