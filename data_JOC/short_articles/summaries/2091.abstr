We have systematically evaluated via computer simulations the impact of scattered radiation, the polyenergetic spectrum, and measurement noise on the performance of three reconstruction algorithms: conventional filtered backprojection (FBP), deterministic iterative deblurring, and a new iterative algorithm, alternating minimization (AM), based on a CT detector model that includes noise, scatter, and polyenergetic spectra. Prospects for quantitative computed tomography imaging in the presence of foreign metal bodies using statistical image reconstruction X-ray computed tomography (CT) images of patients bearing metal intracavitary applicators or other metal foreign objects exhibit severe artifacts including streaks and aliasing. AM image reconstruction, in combination with object-constrained
