These patches can be used to represent the characteristic local features of the molecule in a way that is beyond the atomistic resolution but can nevertheless be applied for the analysis of partial similarities of different molecules as well as for the identification of molecular complementarity in a very general sense. We use the topographical properties of the surface as well as the electrostatic potential, the local lipophilicity/hydrophilicity, and the hydrogen bond density on the surface for characterization.
