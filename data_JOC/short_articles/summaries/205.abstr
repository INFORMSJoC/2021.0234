The surface may or may not be textured. Based on the two paradigms, structure from motion and linear intensity subspaces, we introduce the geotensity constraint that governs the relationship between four or more images of a moving object. We show that it is possible in theory to solve for 3D Lambertian surface structure for the case of a single point light source and propose that a solution exists for an arbitrary number point light sources. Geotensity: combining motion and lighting for 3D surface reconstruction This paper is about automatically reconstructing the full 3D surface of an object observed in motion
