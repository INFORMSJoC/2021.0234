We prove that there exists a Hamiltonian path in Q/sub n/-{v}-F between any two vertices in the partite set without v. Furthermore, all bounds are tight Fault-tolerant Hamiltonian laceability of hypercubes It is known that every hypercube Q/sub n/ is a bipartite graph. Assume that n>or=2 and F is a subset of edges with |F|<or=n-2. Assume that n>or=3 and F is a subset of edges with |F|<or=n-3. Moreover, there exists a path of length 2/sup n/-2 between any two vertices of the same partite set. We prove that there exists a Hamiltonian path in Q/sub n/-F between any two vertices
