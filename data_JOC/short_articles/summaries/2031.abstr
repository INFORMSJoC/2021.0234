Efficient two-level image thresholding method based on Bayesian formulation and the maximum entropy principle An efficient method for two-level thresholding is proposed based on the Bayes formula and the maximum entropy principle, in which no assumptions of the image histogram are made. Five forms of conditional probability distributions-simple, linear, parabola concave, parabola convex, and S-function-are employed and compared to each other for optimal threshold determination. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a significant improvement in speed from 26 to 57 times faster than the exhaustive search method The effect of precision on optimal threshold determination is discussed and
