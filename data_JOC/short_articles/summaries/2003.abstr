Nonlinear modeling and adaptive fuzzy control of MCFC stack To improve availability and performance of fuel cells, the operating temperature of the molten carbonate fuel cells (MCFC) stack should be controlled within a specified range. The parameters of the fuzzy control system are regulated by back-propagation algorithm, and the rule database of the fuzzy system is also adaptively adjusted by the nearest-neighbor-clustering algorithm. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed modeling and design procedures for the MCFC stack based on neural networks identification and the novel adaptive fuzzy control In the paper, a radial basis function neural networks identification
