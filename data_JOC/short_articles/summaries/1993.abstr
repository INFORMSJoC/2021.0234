Color plane interpolation using alternating projections Most commercial digital cameras use color filter arrays to sample red, green, and blue colors according to a specific pattern. We have compared this technique with six state-of-the-art demosaicing techniques, and it outperforms all of them, both visually and in terms of mean square error In this paper we present a new demosaicing technique that uses inter-channel correlation effectively in an alternating-projections scheme. At the location of each pixel only one color sample is taken, and the values of the other colors must be interpolated using neighboring samples. If demosaicing is not performed appropriately,
