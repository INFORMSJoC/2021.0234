Novel ZE-isomerism descriptors derived from molecular topology and their application to QSAR analysis We introduce several series of novel ZE-isomerism descriptors derived directly from two-dimensional molecular topology. The ZE-isomerism descriptors include modified molecular connectivity indices, overall Zagreb indices, extended connectivity, overall connectivity, and topological charge indices. These descriptors make use of a quantity named ZE-isomerism correction, which is added to the vertex degrees of atoms connected by double bonds in Z and E configurations. The applicability of ZE-isomerism descriptors to QSAR analysis is demonstrated in the studies of a series of 131 anticancer agents inhibiting tubulin polymerization This approach is
