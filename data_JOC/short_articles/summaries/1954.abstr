The obtained values differ largely from heuristic values proposed by some authors for the R/S statistics and are very close to asymptotic values for the periodogram regression method Estimating long-range dependence: finite sample properties and confidence intervals A major issue in financial economics is the behavior of asset returns over long horizons. We test R/S analysis, detrended fluctuation analysis and periodogram regression methods on samples drawn from Gaussian white noise. Even though some have known asymptotic properties, it is important to test their accuracy by using simulated series of different lengths. Unfortunately, no asymptotic distribution theory has been derived for
