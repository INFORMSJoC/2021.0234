These blades were designed and manufactured by the Wave Energy Research Team (WERT) at the University of Limerick for the experimental analysis of a 0.6 m impulse turbine with fixed guide vanes for wave energy power conversion. Innovative manufacture of impulse turbine blades for wave energy power conversion An innovative approach to the manufacture of impulse turbine blades using rapid prototyping, fused decomposition modelling (FDM), is presented. The objective of this paper is to present the innovative method used to design, modify and manufacture blades in a time and cost effective manner using a concurrent engineering approach The computer aided
