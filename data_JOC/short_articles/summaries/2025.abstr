Multispectral color image capture using a liquid crystal tunable filter We describe the experimental setup of a multispectral color image acquisition system consisting of a professional monochrome CCD camera and a tunable filter in which the spectral transmittance can be controlled electronically. One consists in applying regression methods to convert from the K camera outputs to a device-independent color space such as CIEXYZ or CIELAB. By inverting the model using a principal eigenvector approach, we estimate the spectral reflectance of each pixel of the imaged surface To convert the camera output signals to device-independent color data, two main approaches are
