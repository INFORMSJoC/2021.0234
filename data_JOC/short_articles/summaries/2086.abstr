The main function of the system, besides estimating the product cost, is to generate initial process planning, including the generation and selection of machining processes, their sequence and their machining parameters, and to recommend the most economical assembly technique for a product and provide design improvement suggestions based on a design feasibility technique. The developed system comprises a computer aided design (CAD) solid modelling system, a material selection module, a knowledge-based system (KBS), a process optimization module, a design for assembly module, a cost estimation module and a user interface. Two case studies were used to validate the developed system
