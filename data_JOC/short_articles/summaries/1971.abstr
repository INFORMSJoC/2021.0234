Specifically, the aims are: (1) to identify key changes in the way hotels are using the Web; (2) to look for evidence of the adoption of a relationship marketing (RM) model as a strategy for the development of hotel Web sites and the use of new technologies; and, (3) To investigate the use of multimedia in hotel Web sites. There is a lack of historical perspective on industry related Web marketing applications and this paper attempts to resolve this with a two-year follow-up case study of the changing use of the Web to develop different types of relationships.
