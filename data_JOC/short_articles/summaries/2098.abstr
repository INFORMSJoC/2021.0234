Later, we prove the existence of weak solutions to certain boundary value problems and initial-boundary value problems associated with the resulting equations for (T/sup 0/, p/sup 0/) but in a more general mathematical setting Nonlinear systems arising from nonisothermal, non-Newtonian Hele-Shaw flows in the presence of body forces and sources In this paper, we first give a formal derivation of several systems of equations for injection moulding. We also derive a nonlinear "Darcy law". Our formulation includes not only the pressure gradient, but also body forces and sources, which play the role of a nonlinearity. We derive systems for both
