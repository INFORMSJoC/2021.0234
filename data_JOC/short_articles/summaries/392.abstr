Time-varying properties of renal autoregulatory mechanisms In order to assess the possible time-varying properties of renal autoregulation, time-frequency and time-scaling methods were applied to renal blood flow under broad-band forced arterial blood pressure fluctuations and single-nephron renal blood flow with spontaneous oscillations obtained from normotensive (Sprague-Dawley, Wistar, and Long-Evans) rats, and spontaneously hypertensive rats. We found a clear difference in Renyi entropy between normotensive and hypertensive blood flow recordings at the whole kidney level for both forced (p < 0.037) and spontaneous arterial pressure fluctuations (p < 0.033), and at the single-nephron level (p < 0.008). Time-frequency analyses of normotensive
