Our experiments demonstrate that estimation of smoothed surface curvatures are very accurate and not affected by the arbitrary direction of the first geodesic line when constructing semigeodesic coordinates. Our technique is independent of the underlying triangulation and is also more efficient than volumetric diffusion techniques since 2-D rather than 3-D convolutions are employed. Estimation of error in curvature computation on multi-scale free-form surfaces A novel technique for multi-scale curvature computation on a free-form 3-D surface is presented. Next, the surface Gaussian and mean curvature values are estimated accurately at multiple scales which are then mapped to colours and displayed directly
