Loudspeaker voice-coil inductance losses: circuit models, parameter estimation, and effect on frequency response When the series resistance is separated and treated as a separate element, it is shown that losses in an inductor require the ratio of the flux to MMF in the core to be frequency dependent. For small-signal operation, this dependence leads to a circuit model composed of a lossless inductor and a resistor in parallel, both of which are frequency dependent. Mathematical expressions for these elements are derived under the assumption that the ratio of core flux to MMF varies as omega /sup n-1/, where n is
