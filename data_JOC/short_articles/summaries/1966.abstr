The nonexistence of stationarity called for the application of recurrence quantification analysis as a tool for this analysis, and is based on the definition of several parameters that allow for the quantification of recurrence plots. Application of nonlinear time series analysis techniques to high-frequency currency exchange data In this work we have applied nonlinear time series analysis to high-frequency currency exchange data. The results show, as expected, the high correlation between the currencies that are part of the Euro, but also a strong correlation between the Japanese Yen, the Canadian Dollar and the British Pound. The time series studied are
