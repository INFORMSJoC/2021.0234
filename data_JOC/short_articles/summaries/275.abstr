Prediction of ultraviolet spectral absorbance using quantitative structure-property relationships High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with ultraviolet (UV) spectrophotometric detection is a common method for analyzing reaction products in organic chemistry. Using the sum of ZINDO oscillator strengths in the integration range as an additional descriptor allowed reduction in the number of descriptors producing a robust model for 460 compounds with five descriptors and a squared correlation coefficient 0.857. Models are now reported for the prediction of the integrated UV absorbance for a diverse set of organic compounds using a quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) approach. A seven-descriptor linear correlation with a
