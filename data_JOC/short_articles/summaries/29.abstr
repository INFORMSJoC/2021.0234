Fuzzy polynomial neural networks: hybrid architectures of fuzzy modeling We introduce a concept of fuzzy polynomial neural networks (FPNNs), a hybrid modeling architecture combining polynomial neural networks (PNNs) and fuzzy neural networks (FNNs). The structure of the PNN is not fixed in advance as it usually takes place in the case of conventional neural networks, but becomes organized dynamically to meet the required approximation error. The obtained experimental results reveal that the proposed networks exhibit high accuracy and generalization capabilities in comparison to other similar fuzzy models The development of the FPNNs dwells on the technologies of computational intelligence (CI),
