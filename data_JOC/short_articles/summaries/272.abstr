Median partitioning: a novel method for the selection of representative subsets from large compound pools A method termed median partitioning (MP) has been developed to select diverse sets of molecules from large compound pools. In each of n subsequent steps, a population of molecules is divided into subpopulations above and below the median value of a property descriptor until a desired number of 2/sup n/ partitions are obtained. Unlike many other methods for subset selection, the MP approach does not depend on pairwise comparison of molecules and can therefore be applied to very large compound collections. MP employs arrays of
