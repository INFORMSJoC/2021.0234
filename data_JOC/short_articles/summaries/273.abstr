Chemical information based scaling of molecular descriptors: a universal chemical scale for library design and analysis Scaling is a difficult issue for any analysis of chemical properties or molecular topology when disparate descriptors are involved. For example, descriptors can be scaled so that compounds with little potential for biological activity, bioavailability, or other drug-like characteristics are easily identified as outliers. Using several publicly available databases (ACD, CMC, MDDR, and NCI) as a basis, we propose to define chemically meaningful scales for a number of molecular properties and topology descriptors. First, it is possible to define chemically relevant scales, greatly simplifying
