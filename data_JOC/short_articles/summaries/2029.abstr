The bit rate is fixed to 2.0 bits/pixel, whose performance is moderate in terms of compression ratio compared to other compression schemes such as discrete cosine transform (DCT), vector quantization (VQ), wavelet transform coding (WTC), etc. Conventional bit plane overhead is 1.0 bits/pixel; we decrease it to 0.734 bits/pixel while maintaining the same decoded quality as absolute moment BTC (AMBTC) does for the "Lena" image. Block truncation image bit plane coding Block truncation coding (BTC) is a successful image compression technique due to its simple and fast computational burden. A new technique is presented to reduce the bit plane overhead.
