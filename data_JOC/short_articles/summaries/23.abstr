It is shown that the absorbing layer can be as thin as desired with respect to the minimum spatial scale of the incident wave and ensures efficient absorption in a wide frequency interval (starting from zero frequency) that is bounded from above only by a finite space-time resolution of the parameter-control operations. Absorption of long waves by nonresonant parametric microstructures Using simple acoustical and mechanical models, we consider the conceptual possibility of designing an active absorbing (nonreflecting) coating in the form of a thin layer with small-scale stratification and fast time modulation of parameters. The majority of the considered algorithms
