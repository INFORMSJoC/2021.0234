An unconditionally stable extended (USE) finite-element time-domain solution of active nonlinear microwave circuits using perfectly matched layers This paper proposes an extension of the unconditionally stable finite-element time-domain (FETD) method for the global electromagnetic analysis of active microwave circuits. A benchmark test on a microwave amplifier indicates that this extended FETD algorithm is not only superior to finite-difference time-domain-based algorithm in mesh flexibility and simulation accuracy, but also reduces computation time dramatically This formulation has two advantages. First, the time-step size is no longer governed by the spatial discretization of the mesh, but rather by the Nyquist sampling criterion. Reflection
