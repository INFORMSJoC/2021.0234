Experiments using synthesized data are important because the ground truth is known, possible confounds due to camera characterization and pre-processing are absent, and various factors affecting color constancy can be efficiently investigated because they can be manipulated individually and precisely. I: Methodology and experiments with synthesized data We introduce a context for testing computational color constancy, specify our approach to the implementation of a number of the leading algorithms, and report the results of three experiments using synthesized data. We investigate the ability of these algorithms to make estimates of three different color constancy quantities: the chromaticity of the scene
