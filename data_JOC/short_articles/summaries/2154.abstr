Optimize/sup IT/ robot condition monitoring tool As robots have gained more and more 'humanlike' capability, users have looked increasingly to their builders for ways to measure the critical variables-the robotic equivalent of a physical check-up-in order to monitor their condition and schedule maintenance more effectively. Developed for ABB robots with an S4-family controller and based on the company's broad process know-how, Optimize/sup IT/ robot condition monitoring offers maintenance routines with embedded checklists that give a clear indication of a robot's operating condition.
