This is in part due to the complexity of the system and to the lack of simulation environments in which to test what the ecological effect of a hypothetical mechanism of interaction would be, before resorting to laboratory experiments. Model intestinal microflora in computer simulation: a simulation and modeling package for host-microflora interactions The ecology of the human intestinal microflora and its interaction with the host are poorly understood. In this paper, the design and evaluation of this simulator is discussed Though more and more data are being acquired, in part using modern molecular methods, development of a quantitative theory
