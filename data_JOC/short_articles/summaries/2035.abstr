In the first step, the decision-maker specifies a target-level point (the desired criterion values); then in the set of vector evaluations we seek points that are closest to the target point in the Chebyshev metric. We prove the relationship between the evaluations and decisions obtained by the proposed procedure, on the one hand, and the efficient (weakly efficient) evaluations and decisions, on the other hand. Search for efficient solutions of multi-criterion problems by target-level method The target-level method is considered for solving continuous multi-criterion maximization problems. If the Edgeworth-Pareto hull of the set of vector evaluations is convex, the set
