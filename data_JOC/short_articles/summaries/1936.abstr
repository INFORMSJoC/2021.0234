A new approach to the decomposition of Boolean,functions that depend on n variables and are represented in various forms is considered. The approach is based on the method of q-partitioning of minterms and on the introduced concept of a decomposition clone. The theorem on simple disjunctive decomposition of full and partial functions is formulated. A new approach to the decomposition of Boolean functions by the method of q-partitions.II. The approach proposed is illustrated by examples 6, p. 29-42 (1999). Sist. Mash., no. see Upr. Repeated decomposition For pt.I.
