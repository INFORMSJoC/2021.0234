Simulation of evacuation processes using a bionics-inspired cellular automaton model for pedestrian dynamics We present simulations of evacuation processes using a recently introduced cellular automaton model for pedestrian dynamics. These times depend on the strength of the herding behaviour, with minimal evacuation times for some intermediate values of the couplings, i.e., a proper combination of herding and use of knowledge about the shortest way to the exit It is shown that the variation of the model parameters allows to describe different types of behaviour, from regular to panic. This model applies a bionics approach to describe the interaction between the
