Comprehensive encoding and decoupling solution to problems of decoherence and design in solid-state quantum computing Proposals for scalable quantum computing devices suffer not only from decoherence due to the interaction with their environment, but also from severe engineering constraints. Decoherence is first reduced by encoding a logical qubit into two qubits, then completely eliminated by an efficient set of decoupling pulse sequences. We further show how the dominant decoherence processes can be identified empirically, in order to optimize the decoupling pulses Here we introduce a practical solution to these major concerns, addressing solid-state proposals in particular. The same encoding removes
