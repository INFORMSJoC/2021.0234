Streaming which is a diffusive behavior, arises in large burst sizes and is more likely in a single-exit room with w = 1 and leads to a counterintuitive result wherein an average exit throughput Q is obtained that is higher than with w = 2, 3, or 4. A pedestrian could move forward, backward, left or right within each iteration time depending on adjacent cell vacancy and in accordance with simple rules that determine the compulsion to move and physical capability relative to his neighbors. If the doors are not separated far enough (< 4w), Q becomes even significantly less
