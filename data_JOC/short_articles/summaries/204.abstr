As the proposed technique neither requires a special set up nor needs exact correspondence it is potentially useful for the calibration of active vision systems which have to acquire knowledge about their intrinsic parameters while they perform other tasks, or as a tool for analyzing image sequences in large video databases Self-calibration from image derivatives This study investigates the problem of estimating camera calibration parameters from image motion fields induced by a rigidly moving camera with unknown parameters, where the image formation is modeled with a linear pinhole-camera model. New constraints on the smoothness of the surfaces in view are
