Previous proposals required drastic increases in asymmetry and knowledge to work, whereas our protocol does not use any additional knowledge, and does not require more symmetry-breaking conditions than available; thus, it is also stabilizing with respect to dynamic changes in the topology. Universal dynamic synchronous self-stabilization We prove the existence of a "universal" synchronous self-stabilizing protocol, that is, a protocol that allows a distributed system to stabilize to a desired nonreactive behaviour (as long as a protocol stabilizing to that behaviour exists). Moreover, an optimal D + 1 protocol is given for the case of unique identifiers. We prove an
