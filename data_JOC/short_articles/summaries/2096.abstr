A spatial rainfall simulator for crop production modeling in Southern Africa This paper describes a methodology for simulating rainfall in dekads across a set of spatial units in areas where long-term meteorological records are available for a small number of sites only. Preliminary analysis of rainfall data for these stations suggested that intra-seasonal temporal correlation was negligible, but that rainfall at any given station was correlated with rainfall at neighbouring stations. For each ward, log-transformed rainfall for each of the 36 dekads in the year was characterized by a mean and standard deviation, which were interpolated from surrounding meteorological stations.
