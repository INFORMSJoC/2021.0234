Incremental motion control of linear synchronous motor In this study a particular incremental motion control problem, which is specified by the trapezoidal velocity profile using multisegment sliding mode control (MSSMC), is proposed to control a permanent magnet linear synchronous motor (PMLSM) servo drive system. Then, each segment of the multisegment switching surfaces is designed to match the corresponding part of the trapezoidal velocity profile, thus the motor dynamics on the specified-segment switching surface have the desired velocity or acceleration corresponding part of the trapezoidal velocity profile. Second, a field-oriented control PMLSM servo drive is introduced. Finally, the effectiveness of the
