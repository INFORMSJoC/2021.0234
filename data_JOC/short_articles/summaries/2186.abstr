Multi-round protocols are bound to be effective, and strategies that use a priori information about the structure-directing libraries are found to be the best Strategies for high throughput, templated zeolite synthesis The design and redesign of high throughput experiments for zeolite synthesis are addressed. Using this model, several Monte Carlo-like design protocols are evaluated. A model that relates materials function to the chemical composition of the zeolite and the structure directing agent is introduced.
