Fusion of qualitative bond graph and genetic algorithms: A fault diagnosis application In this paper, the problem of fault diagnosis via integration of genetic algorithms (GA's) and qualitative bond graphs (QBG's) is addressed. In order to demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm, we have tested the proposed algorithm on an in-house designed and built floating disc experimental setup. Fault diagnosis is activated by a fault detection mechanism when a discrepancy between measured abnormal behavior and predicted system behavior is observed. The qualitative bond graph provides a unified approach for modeling engineering systems, in particular, mechatronic systems. Additional measurements will
