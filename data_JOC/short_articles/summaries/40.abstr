New tuning method for PID controller In this paper, a tuning method for proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller and the performance assessment formulas for this method are proposed. The relationship between the controller parameters and the parameters that characterize the process dynamics are determined and the tuning formula is then derived. For deriving the tuning formula, the genetic algorithm based design method is applied to design PID controllers for a variety of processes. Simulations and real-time experimental results are given to demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of these formulas Using simulation studies, the rules for assessing the performance of a PID controller
