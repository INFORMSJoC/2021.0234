Adaptive filtering for noise reduction in hue saturation intensity color space Even though the hue saturation intensity (HSI) color model has been widely used in color image processing and analysis, the conversion formulas from the RGB color model to HSI are nonlinear and complicated in comparison with the conversion formulas of other color models. We have analyzed the noise characteristics of the HSI color model and developed an adaptive spatial filtering method to reduce the magnitude of noise and the nonuniformity of noise variance in the HSI color space. When an RGB image is degraded by random Gaussian noise, this
