Then the convolution of the circular mask diffraction with periodic rectangular apertures is put together, and we can present a simple mathematical tool to analyze the mask properties including the intensity distribution, blurring aberration, and the criterion of defining the far- or near-field diffraction. Diffraction limit for a circular mask with a periodic rectangular apertures array A mask with periodic apertures imaging system is adopted very widely and plays a leading role in modern technology for uses such as pinhole cameras, coded imaging systems, optical information processing, etc. The far-field diffraction formula modified for a multiaperture mask has been proposed
