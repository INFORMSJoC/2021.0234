The nature of IA design is well described by Constructive Induction (CI), a design process that involves locating the best representational framework for the design problem, identifying a solution within that framework and translating it back to the design problem at hand. IA is inductive partly because it lacks internal theory, and partly because it is an activity that supports emergent phenomena (user experiences) from basic design components. Information architecture without internal theory: an inductive design process This article suggests that Information Architecture (IA) design is primarily an inductive process. Although top-level goals, user attributes and available content are periodically
