Using molecular equivalence numbers to visually explore structural features that distinguish chemical libraries A molecular equivalence number (meqnum) classifies a molecule with respect to a class of structural features or topological shapes such as its cyclic system or its set of functional groups. In our analyses, we discover some interesting features of the topological shape of a molecule and its set of functional groups that are strongly linked with compounds occurring in the MDDR but not in the ACD. In the examples we compare a library which is a random sample from the MDL Drug Data Report (MDDR) with a
