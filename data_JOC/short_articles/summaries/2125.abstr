Stochastic systems with a random jump in phase trajectory: stability of their motions The probabilistic stability of the perturbed motion of a system with parameters under the action of a general Markov process is studied. The applied approach is helpful in studying the asymptotic probabilistic stability and mean-square exponential stability of stochastic systems through the stability of the respective deterministic systems The phase vector is assumed to experience random jumps when the structure the system suffers random jumps. of nonlinear systems in the first approximation are studied. Such a situation is encountered, for example, in the motion of a solid
