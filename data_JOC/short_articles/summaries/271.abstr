These findings are rationalized using Krogh and Vedelsby's (1995) decomposition of the generalization error into a term that measures the average generalization performance of the individual networks and a term that measures the diversity among them. On the use of neural network ensembles in QSAR and QSPR Despite their growing popularity among neural network practitioners, ensemble methods have not been widely adopted in structure-activity and structure-property correlation. Although aggregation does offer definitive advantages, we demonstrate that bagging may not be the best possible choice and that simpler techniques such as retraining with the full sample can often produce superior results.
