Adaptive and efficient mutual exclusion The paper presents adaptive algorithms for mutual exclusion using only read and write operations; the performance of the algorithms depends only on the point contention, i.e., the number of processes that are concurrently active during algorithm execution (and not on n, the total number of processes). The system response time is the time interval between subsequent entries to the critical section, where one time unit is the minimal interval in which every active process performs at least one step. We show how to make the space complexity of our algorithm depend solely on n, while
