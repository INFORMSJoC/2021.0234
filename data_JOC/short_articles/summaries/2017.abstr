The theoretical formula of the eccentric light beam approach deduced can be applied not only to an object lens whose objective plane is just at the focal plane, but also to an object lens whose objective plane is not at the focal plane. Autofocus system for microscope A technique is developed for microscope autofocusing, which is called the eccentric light beam approach with high resolution, wide focusing range, and compact construction. A defocused signal is acquired by a symmetrical silicon photocell for the change of the reflected light position caused by differential amplification and processed by a microprocessor. Then the
