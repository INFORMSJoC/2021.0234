This technique decreases the reagent consumption (total reaction volume 0.75-1 mu L), the time requirement of the PCR (15-20 min) and subsequent ultrathin-layer gel electrophoresis based fragment analysis (5 min) by automating the current manual procedure and reducing the human intervention using sample loading robots and computerized real time data analysis. Rapid microwell polymerase chain reaction with subsequent ultrathin-layer gel electrophoresis of DNA Large-scale genotyping, mapping and expression profiling require affordable, fully automated high-throughput devices enabling rapid, high-performance analysis using minute quantities of reagents. This system employs integrated scanning laser-induced fluorescence-avalanche photodiode detection and combines the advantages of conventional slab
