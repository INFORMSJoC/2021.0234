A survey of interactive mesh-cutting techniques and a new method for implementing generalized interactive mesh cutting using virtual tools In our experience, mesh-cutting methods can be distinguished by how their solutions address the following major issues: definition of the cut path, primitive removal and re-meshing, number of new primitives created, when re-meshing is performed, and representation of the cutting tool. Many researchers have developed schemes for interactive mesh cutting with the goals of reducing the number of new primitives created, creating new primitives with good aspect ratios, avoiding a disconnected mesh structure between primitives in the cut path, and representing
