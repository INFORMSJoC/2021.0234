Preintegration lateral inhibition enhances unsupervised learning A large and influential class of neural network architectures uses postintegration lateral inhibition as a mechanism for competition. This form of competition, implemented through preintegration lateral inhibition, does provide appropriate coding properties and can be used to learn such representations efficiently. We argue that these algorithms are computationally deficient in that they fail to generate, or learn, appropriate perceptual representations under certain circumstances. An alternative neural network architecture is presented here in which nodes compete for the right to receive inputs rather than for the right to generate outputs. We thus argue that preintegration
