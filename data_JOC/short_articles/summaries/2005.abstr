State-of-the-art in orthopaedic surgical navigation with a focus on medical image modalities This paper presents a review of surgical navigation systems in orthopaedics and categorizes these systems according to the image modalities that are used for the visualization of surgical action. Preoperative image data such as computed tomography scans or intra operatively generated images (for example, ultrasonic, endoscopic or fluoroscopic images) are suitable for this purpose. Points on the anatomy are digitized interactively by the surgeon and are used to build up an abstract geometrical model of the bony structures to be operated on. A new category of medical images
