Available software packages (e.g., Data Desk 6.1, MatLab 6.1, SAS-JMP 4.04, SPSS 10.0) are capable of producing three-dimensional scatter plots with (varying degrees of) user interactivity. We constructed our own data visualization application with the Visualization Toolkit (Schroeder et al., 1998) and Tcl/Tk to display multivariate data through the application of glyphs (Ware, 2000). The graphical interface provides flexibility when users dynamically explore the multidimensional image rendered from raw experimental data. A glyph is a visual object onto which many data parameters may be mapped, each with a different visual attribute (e.g., size or color). Multidimensional data visualization Historically, data
