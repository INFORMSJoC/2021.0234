Restoration of broadband imagery steered with a liquid-crystal optical phased array In many imaging applications, it is highly desirable to replace mechanical beam-steering components (i.e., mirrors and gimbals) with a nonmechanical device. First, dispersion will cause different incident wavelengths arriving at the same angle to be steered to different output angles, causing chromatic aberrations in the image plane. The technique, however, is applicable only to scenes containing objects with approximately constant reflectivities over the spectral region of interest. However, when a phase grating is used in a broadband imaging system, two adverse effects can occur. Second, the device will steer
