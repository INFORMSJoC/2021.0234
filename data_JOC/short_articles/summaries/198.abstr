If the olfactory bulb may be thought of as a collection of such processing elements, each responsible for the discrimination of a single odorant, our study provides a quantitative analysis of the potential computational properties of the olfactory bulb. Computational capacity of an odorant discriminator: the linear separability of curves We introduce and study an artificial neural network inspired by the probabilistic receptor affinity distribution model of olfaction. The mathematical formulation of the problem we consider is one of determining the capacity for linear separability of continuous curves, embedded in a large-dimensional space. This is accomplished here by a numerical
