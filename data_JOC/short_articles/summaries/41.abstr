Controller performance analysis with LQG benchmark obtained under closed loop conditions This paper proposes a new method for obtaining a linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) benchmark in terms of the variances of process input and output from closed-loop data, for assessing the controller performance. The optimal LQG-benchmark variances are obtained directly from the subspace matrices corresponding to the deterministic inputs and the stochastic inputs, which are identified using closed-loop data with setpoint excitation. LQG benchmark has been proposed in the literature to assess controller performance since the LQG tradeoff curve represents the limit of performance in terms of input and output
