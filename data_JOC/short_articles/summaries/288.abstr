Complexity transitions in global algorithms for sparse linear systems over finite fields We study the computational complexity of a very basic problem, namely that of finding solutions to a very large set of random linear equations in a finite Galois field modulo q. Using tools from statistical mechanics we are able to identify phase transitions in the structure of the solution space and to connect them to the changes in the performance of a global algorithm, namely Gaussian elimination. We illustrate the results on the specific problem of integer factorization, which is of central interest for deciphering messages encrypted with
