Effective moving cast shadow detection for monocular color traffic image sequences For an accurate scene analysis using monocular color traffic image sequences, a robust segmentation of moving vehicles from the stationary background is generally required. The proposed method is tested on 100 vehicle images taken under different lighting conditions (sunny and cloudy), viewing angles (roadside and overhead), vehicle sizes (small, medium, and large), and colors (similar to the road and not). By observing the characteristics of cast shadow in the luminance, chrominance, gradient density, and geometry domains, a combined probability map, called a shadow confidence score (SCS), is obtained. We
