Model selection in electromagnetic source analysis with an application to VEFs In electromagnetic source analysis, it is necessary to determine how many sources are required to describe the electroencephalogram or magnetoencephalogram adequately. The adjusted Hotelling's test is recommended if a conservative approach is taken and MSPs such as Bayes information criterion or the Wald test on source amplitudes are recommended if a more liberal approach is desirable. Existing and new MSPs are evaluated in different source and noise settings: two sources which are close or distant and noise which is uncorrelated or correlated. The MSPs are applied to empirical data
