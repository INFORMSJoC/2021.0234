This paper also briefly describes the concept of the implementation of such a comprehensive model along with an on-line error assessment and calibration system in a PC-based open-architecture controller environment, so that it could be employed in regular production for the purpose of periodic calibration of machine tools Support vector machines model for classification of thermal error in machine tools This paper addresses a change in the concept of machine tool thermal error prediction which has been hitherto carried out by directly mapping them with the temperature of critical elements on the machine. The model developed herein using support vector
