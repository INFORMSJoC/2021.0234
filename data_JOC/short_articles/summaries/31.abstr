Both indirect and direct adaptive control methods are developed, where the spatially localized models (in the form of Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy systems or radial basis function neural networks) are used as online approximators to learn the unknown dynamics of the system. Without assumptions on rate of change of system dynamics, the proposed adaptive control methods guarantee that all internal signals of the system are bounded and the tracking error is asymptotically stable. Adaptive neural/fuzzy control for interpolated nonlinear systems Adaptive control for nonlinear time-varying systems is of both theoretical and practical importance. This class of systems is composed of interpolations of
