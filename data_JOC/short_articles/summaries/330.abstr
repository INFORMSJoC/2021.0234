Improving computer security for authentication of users: influence of proactive password restrictions Entering a user name-password combination is a widely used procedure for identification and authentication in computer systems. The additional restrictions greatly increased the time it took to generate the password but had only a small effect on the time it took to use it subsequently to log in. The results indicate that increasing the minimum character length reduces crackability and increases security, regardless of whether additional restrictions are imposed In two experiments, we examined the influence of proactive password restrictions on the time that it took to generate
