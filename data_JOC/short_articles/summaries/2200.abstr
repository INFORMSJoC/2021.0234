Our goal in creating it was to simplify, laboratory work by making information available where it is needed and by collecting and organizing data where and when it is created into a formal representation that others can understand and process. A user-driven system, although technologically conservative, embraces a central goal of ubiquitous computing: to enhance the ability to perform domain tasks through fluid interaction with computational resources. By helping biologists produce a more complete record of their work with less effort, Labscape is designed to foster improved collaboration in conjunction with increased individual efficiency and satisfaction. Smart environments could soon
