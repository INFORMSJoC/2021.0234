Limits for computational electromagnetics codes imposed by computer architecture The algorithmic complexity of the innermost loops that determine the complexity of algorithms in computational electromagnetics (CEM) codes are analyzed according to their operation count and the impact of the underlying computer hardware. As memory chips are much slower than arithmetic processors, codes that involve a high data movement compared to the number of arithmetic operations are executed comparatively slower. It is seen that it is not sufficient to compare only the complexity, but also the actual performance of algorithms to judge on faster execution. Run times on two reference platforms,
