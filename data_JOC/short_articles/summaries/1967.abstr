We find that SSA decomposes the volatility series quite well and effectively captures both the market trend (accounting for about 34-38% of the total variance in the series) and, more importantly, a number of underlying market periodicities. Modeling daily realized futures volatility with singular spectrum analysis Using singular spectrum analysis (SSA), we model the realized volatility and logarithmic standard deviations of two important futures return series. Reliable identification of any periodicities is extremely important for options pricing and risk management and we believe that SSA can be a useful addition to the financial practitioners' toolbox The realized volatility and logarithmic
