The author develops some analytic machinery that can be used to map the authority structures of such organizations, and show that under mild restrictions there is a well-defined ultimate control group.

The ultimate control group Empirical research on the organization of firms requires that firms be classified on the basis of their control structures. It is easy to identify the ultimate controller of a hierarchical organization, and the literature has largely focused on this case.
