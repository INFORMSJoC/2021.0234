The development of a mobile manipulator imaging system for bridge crack inspection A mobile manipulator imaging system is developed for the automation of bridge crack inspection. Currently, the inspectors must stand on the platform of a bridge inspection vehicle or a temporarily erected scaffolding to examine the underside of a bridge. The manipulator system is equipped with binocular charge coupled devices (CCD) for examining structures that may not be accessible to the eye. To help automate the bridge crack inspection process, we installed two CCD cameras and a four-axis manipulator system on a mobile vehicle. During bridge safety inspections, an
