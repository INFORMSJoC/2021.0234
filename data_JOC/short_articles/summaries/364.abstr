MACLP extends CSPCONS, a logic programming system that permits distributed program execution through communicating sequential Prolog processes with constraints, by providing all the necessary facilities for communication between agents. MACLP: multi agent constraint logic programming Multi agent systems (MAS) have become the key technology for decomposing complex problems in order to solve them more efficiently, or for problems distributed in nature. they are combinatorial. This paper presents MACLP (multi agent constraint logic programming), a logic programming platform for building, in a declarative way, multi agent systems with constraint-solving capabilities. Solving such particularly hard problems efficiently requires programming tools that combine
