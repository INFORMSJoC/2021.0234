There is no optimal routing policy for the torus A routing policy is the method used to select a specific output channel for a message from among a number of acceptable output channels. Our result is demonstrated by presenting a detailed example in which the best choice of output channel is dependent on the probability of each channel being available. An optimal routing policy is a policy that maximizes the probability of a message reaching its destination without delays. Optimal routing policies have been proposed for several regular networks, including the mesh and the hypercube. This result settles, in the
