In this method, the variances of the increments of noise and signal are equal, so that, in observations with a greater step, the variations caused by noise are smaller than those caused by the signal. Measur., vol.IM-36, p.646-54, 1987) proposed a simple method of determining the interval between equally accurate observations which does without this information. Allan variance and fractal Brownian motion Noise filtering is the subject of a voluminous literature in radio engineering. The present paper is devoted to a statistical analysis of the Allan method and acquisition of additional information Instr. The methods of filtering require knowledge of
