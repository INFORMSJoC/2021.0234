Matched-filter template generation via spatial filtering: application to fetal biomagnetic recordings We have developed a two-step procedure for signal processing of fetal biomagnetic recordings that removes cardiac interference and noise. The key difference between our MF and a conventional one is that the interference template and the template scaling are derived from a signal that has been spatially filtered to isolate the interference, rather than from the raw signal. When followed by a SSP that preserves only the signal subspace, the noise is reduced to a low level First, a modified matched filter (MF) is applied to remove maternal cardiac
