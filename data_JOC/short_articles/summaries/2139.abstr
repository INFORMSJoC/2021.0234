For a normally distributed random vector with an inaccurately known mean value, generalized confidence sets are built tip and the dependence of sizes of a generalized confidence set on the forms and parameters of a set of possible mean values is examined Generalized confidence sets for a statistically indeterminate random vector A problem is considered for the construction of confidence sets for a random vector, the information on distribution parameters of which is incomplete. Properties of generalized confidence sets are studied. To obtain exact estimates and a detailed analysis of the problem, the notion is introduced of a generalized confidence
