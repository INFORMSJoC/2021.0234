In contrast to earlier unwrapping algorithms by region, we propose a local discontinuity-restoring criterion to serve as the preprocessor or postprocessor of our hybrid algorithm, which makes the unwrapping by region much easier and more efficient. Innovative phase unwrapping algorithm: hybrid approach We present a novel algorithm based on a hybrid of the global and local treatment of a wrapped map. The proposed algorithm can be easily upgraded with minor modifications to solve the unwrapping problem of maps with phase inconsistency. Both numerical simulation and experimental applications demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm With this hybrid algorithm, a robust,
