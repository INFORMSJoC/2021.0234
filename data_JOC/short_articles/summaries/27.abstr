Therefore, such fuzzy automata are still (abstract) devices for computing with values, although a certain vagueness or uncertainty are involved in the process of computation. This principle indicates that computing with words can be implemented with computing with values with the price of a big amount of extra computations Fuzzy automata are generalizations of classical automata where the knowledge about the system's next state is vague or uncertain. We introduce a new kind of fuzzy automata whose inputs are instead strings of fuzzy subsets of the input alphabet. It is worth noting that like classical automata, fuzzy automata can only
