Experiments with synthesized data (part one of this paper) suggested that the methods which emphasize the use of the input data statistics, specifically color by correlation and the neural net algorithm, are potentially the most effective at estimating the chromaticity of the scene illuminant. Here exploiting pixel intensity proved to be more beneficial than exploiting the details of image chromaticity statistics, and the three-dimensional (3-D) gamut-mapping algorithms gave the best performance All data used for this study are available online at http://www.cs.sfu.ca/~color/data, and implementations for most of the algorithms are also available (http://www.cs.sfu.ca/~color/code). The algorithms studied include two gray world
