Visual-word identification thresholds for the 260 fragmented words of the Snodgrass and Vanderwart pictures in Spanish Word difficulty varies from language to language; therefore, normative data of verbal stimuli cannot be imported directly from another language. Finally, of the 11 psycholinguistic variables that previous researchers have shown to affect word identification, only imagery accounted for a significant amount of variance in the threshold values We present mean identification thresholds for the 260 screen-fragmented words corresponding to the total set of Snodgrass and Vanderwart (1980) pictures. An unspecific learning effect was found showing that performance improved due to practice with the
