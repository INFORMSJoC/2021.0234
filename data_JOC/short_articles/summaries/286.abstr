Real-time tissue characterization on the basis of in vivo Raman spectra The application of in vivo Raman spectroscopy for clinical diagnosis demands dedicated software that can perform the necessary signal processing and subsequent (multivariate) data analysis, enabling clinically relevant parameters to be extracted and made available in real time. The implementation is illustrated by a computationally demanding application for the classification of skin spectra using principal component analysis and linear discriminant analysis The design is based on automatic data exchange between Grams, a spectroscopic data acquisition and analysis program, and Matlab, a program designed for array-based calculations. Here we describe
