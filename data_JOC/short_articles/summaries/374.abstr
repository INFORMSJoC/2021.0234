Horizontal waypoint guidance design using optimal control A horizontal waypoint guidance algorithm is proposed by applying line-following guidance to waypoint line segments in sequence. Also derived is a sufficient condition for the stability bound of ground speed changes based on the Lyapunov stability theorem. The line-following guidance is designed using an LQR (linear quadratic regulator). Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively guide a vehicle along the sequence of waypoint line segments Then, the optimal waypoint changing points are derived by minimizing the accelerations required for changing the waypoint line segments.
