The preprocessings are designed using the latest source parameter estimates obtained from the source trackers, and a redesign is activated periodically or whenever any source has been detected by the source trackers to have made significant movement. Separation and tracking of multiple broadband sources with one electromagnetic vector sensor A structure for adaptively separating, enhancing and tracking uncorrelated sources with an electromagnetic vector sensor (EMVS) is presented. Compared with conventional adaptive beamforming, the algorithm has the advantage that no a priori information on any desired signal location is needed, the sources are separated at maximum SNR, and their locations are
