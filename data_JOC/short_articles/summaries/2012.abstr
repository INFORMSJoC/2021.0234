Strain contouring using Gabor filters: principle and algorithm Moire interferometry is a powerful technique for high sensitivity in-plane deformation contouring. Optical methods provide contours that still need to be quantified, while digital methods suffer from drawbacks inherent in the digital differentiation process. Appropriate filter design allows for user-specific segmentation, which is essentially in engineering design and analysis However, from an engineering viewpoint, the derivatives of displacement, i.e., strain, are the desired parameter. We describe a novel approach of strain segmentation for the moire pattern using a multichannel Gabor filter. Optical and digital methods have been proposed for this differentiation. Thus
