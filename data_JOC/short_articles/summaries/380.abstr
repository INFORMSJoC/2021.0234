Quantitative speed control for SRM drive using fuzzy adapted inverse model Quantitative and robust speed control for a switched reluctance motor (SRM) drive is considered to be rather difficult and challenging owing to its highly nonlinear dynamic behavior. To improve this, the inverse model is adaptively tuned by a fuzzy control scheme so that the model-following tracking error is significantly reduced. Then a reference model and a command feedforward controller based on an inverse plant model are employed to yield the desired tracking response at nominal case. As the variations of system parameters and operating conditions occur, the prescribed control
