Accurate modeling of lossy nonuniform transmission lines by using differential quadrature methods This paper discusses an efficient numerical approximation technique, called the differential quadrature method (DQM), which has been adapted to model lossy uniform and nonuniform transmission lines. Although the rationalization process in DQM is comparable with the Pade approximation of asymptotic waveform evaluation (AWE) applied to transmission lines, the derivation mechanisms in these two disparate methods are significantly different. Unlike AWE, which employs a complex moment-matching process to obtain rational approximation, the DQM requires no approximation of transcendental functions, thereby avoiding the process of moment generation and moment matching.
