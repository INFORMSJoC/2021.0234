The results are counter to the arguments that learning algorithms based on weight adaptation after each exemplar presentation (such as the long term potentiation found in the mammalian nervous system) cannot in principle extract symbolic knowledge from positive examples as prescribed by prevailing human linguistic theory and evolutionary psychology On the emergence of rules in neural networks A simple associationist neural network learns to factor abstract rules (i.e., grammars) from sequences of arbitrary input symbols by inventing abstract representations that accommodate unseen symbol sets as well as unseen but similar grammars. Generalization to new symbol sets or grammars arises from
