A new subspace identification approach based on principal component analysis Principal component analysis (PCA) has been widely used for monitoring complex industrial processes with multiple variables and diagnosing process and sensor faults. For comparison the MOESP algorithm and N4SID algorithm are used as benchmarks to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed PCA based subspace model identification (SMI) algorithm PCA naturally falls into the category of EIV formulation, which resembles total least squares and allows for errors in both process input and output. The proposed subspace identification method is demonstrated using a simulated process and a real industrial process for model
