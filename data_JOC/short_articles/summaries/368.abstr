Even if additional biological hints can be added, this model allow us to better understand how a biological model can be implemented and how biological properties can emerge from a distributed set of units From a biological to a computational model for the autonomous behavior of an animat Endowing an autonomous system like a robot with intelligent behavior is difficult for several reasons. It is then easier to report experiments allowing an autonomous system to learn regularities of a simple environment and to exploit them to satisfy some internal drives. A biological model is presented, based on the definition of
