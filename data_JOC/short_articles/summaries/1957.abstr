The two populations' cellular automata model with predation based on the Penna model In Penna's (1995) single-species asexual bit-string model of biological ageing, the Verhulst factor has too strong a restraining effect on the development of the population. The results show that both the quantity of the wolves and the sheep fluctuate in accordance with the law that one quantity increases while the other one decreases Danuta Makowiec gave an improved model based on the lattice, where the restraining factor of the four neighbours take the place of the Verhulst factor. A cellular automata model containing movable wolves and sheep
