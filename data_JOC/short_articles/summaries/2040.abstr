Inverse problems for a mathematical model of ion exchange in a compressible ion exchanger A mathematical model of ion exchange is considered, allowing for ion exchanger compression in the process of ion exchange. The efficiency of the proposed methods is demonstrated by a numerical experiment Two inverse problems are investigated for this model, unique solvability is proved, and numerical solution methods are proposed.
