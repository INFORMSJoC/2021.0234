By introducing a matrix formulation and the concept of accumulation moments, this paper presents an algorithm which is computationally much more efficient than convolving and yet as simple Efficient computation of local geometric moments Local moments have attracted attention as local features in applications such as edge detection and texture segmentation. Nevertheless, moments computed inside overlapping windows are not independent and convolution does not take this fact into account. The main reason for this is that they are inherently integral-based features, so that their use reduces the effect of uncorrelated noise. The computation of local moments, when viewed as a
