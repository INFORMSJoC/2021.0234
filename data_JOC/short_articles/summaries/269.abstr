The subset selection method implemented in GAS has been first tested using an artificial data set (n = 100 points; nu = 1 descriptor) to examine its ability to subset data points and second applied to analyze the XLOGP data set (n = 1831 compounds; nu = 126 descriptors). The analysis of the XLOGP data set shows that the subset selection method can be useful in improving a QSAR/QSPR model when the variable selection method fails Genetic algorithm guided selection: variable selection and subset selection A novel genetic algorithm guided selection method, GAS, has been described. A genetic algorithm is
