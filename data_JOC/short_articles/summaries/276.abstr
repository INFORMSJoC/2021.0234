One hundred forty-seven computational models including different fragment sets coupled with linear or nonlinear fitting equations were applied for the data sets containing 69 (Na/sup +/), 123 (K/sup +/), and 31 (Cs/sup +/) compounds. Assessment of the macrocyclic effect for the complexation of crown-ethers with alkali cations using the substructural molecular fragments method The Substructural Molecular Fragments method (Solov'ev, V. P.; Varnek, A. "Predicted" stability constants both for macrocyclic compounds and for their open-chain analogues are in good agreement with the experimental data reported earlier and with those studied experimentally in this work. 2000, 40, 847-858) was applied to assess
