The spawned filters are based on varying degrees of partial failures (in terms of effectiveness) associated with the complete-actuaton-failure hypothesis with the highest conditional probability of correctness at the current time. Thus, a blended estimate of the failure effectiveness is found using the filters' estimates based upon a no-failure hypothesis, a complete actuator failure hypothesis, and the spawned filters' partial-failure hypotheses. Multiple model adaptive estimation with filter spawning Multiple model adaptive estimation (MMAE) with filter spawning is used to detect and estimate partial actuator failures on the VISTA F-16. This yields substantial precision in effectiveness estimation, compared with what is
