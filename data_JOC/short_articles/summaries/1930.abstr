A formal system representation, as well as an axiomatics of the calculus of systems as functional flow-type objects based on a Node-Function-Object class hierarchy are proposed. The paper presents the results of development of an object-oriented systemological method used to design complex systems. A new method of systemological analysis coordinated with the procedure of object-oriented design. A formalized NFO/UFO analysis algorithm and CASE tools used to support it are considered KhGPU, no.81, p.15-18 (2000). II For pt.I. see Vestn.
