Noninvasive myocardial activation time imaging: a novel inverse algorithm applied to clinical ECG mapping data Linear approaches like the minimum-norm least-square algorithm show insufficient performance when it comes to estimating the activation time map on the surface of the heart from electrocardiographic (ECG) mapping data. The proposed approach shows excellent numerical and computational performance, even under clinical conditions at which the Gauss-Newton approach begins to break down Both methods are applied to simulated ECG mapping data as well as to single beat sinus rhythm data from two patients recorded in the catheter laboratory. For this reason, we have developed an
