The predictions made using these neural models are compared for accuracy with observations and with the prognoses prepared using six models: two hydrodynamic models, a statistical model, a nearest neighbor model, the persistence model, and the verbal forecasts that are broadcast and kept on record by the Sea Level Forecast Service of the Federal Maritime and Hydrography Agency (BSH) in Hamburg. Two concepts, originally developed to solve the problems of convergence of other network types, are proposed to be applied to Kohonen networks: a functional relationship between the number of neurons and the number of learning examples and a criterion
