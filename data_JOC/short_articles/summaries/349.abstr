Our scheme is based on resource partitioning and designated "degrade QoS areas" such that system resources are partitioned into priority areas each of which is reserved specifically to serve only clients in a corresponding class with no QoS degradation, plus one "degraded QoS area" into which all clients can be admitted with QoS adjustment being applied only to the lowest priority clients. A self-adjusting quality of service control scheme We propose and analyze a self-adjusting Quality of Service (QoS) control scheme with the goal of optimizing the system reward as a result of servicing different priority clients with varying workload,
