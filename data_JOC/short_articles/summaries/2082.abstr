Managing safety and strategic stocks to improve materials requirements planning performance This paper provides a methodology for managing safety and strategic stocks in materials requirements planning (MRP) environments to face uncertainty in market demand. A case study is reported, where the benefits from adopting the new proposed methodology lie in achieving the target service level even under peak demand conditions, with the value of safety stocks as a whole growing only by about 20 per cent The study reveals also that most of the decisions are system specific, so that they should be evaluated in a quantitative manner through simulation.
