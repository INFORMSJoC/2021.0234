Robust wavelet neuro control for linear brushless motors Design, simulation and experimental implementation of a wavelet basis function network learning controller for linear brushless dc motors (LBDCM) are considered. Then, a wavelet neural network is applied on a real LBDCM to on-line suppress the friction force, which may be variable due to the different lubrication. The state feedback controller is designed on the basis of a simple linear model, and the learning feedback component is a wavelet neural controller. It consists of two parts, one is a state feedback component, and the other one is a learning feedback component. The
