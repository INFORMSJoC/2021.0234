It was shown that any l-level circuit based on the multivalued components is representable as an algebraic model based on l linear arithmetic polynomials mapped correspondingly into l decision diagrams that are linear and planar by nature. Linear models of circuits based on the multivalued components Linearization and planarization of the circuit models is pivotal to the submicron technologies. Complexity of representing a circuit as the linear decision diagram was estimated as O(G) with G for the number of multivalued components in the circuit. On the other hand, the characteristics of the VLSI circuits can be sometimes improved by using
