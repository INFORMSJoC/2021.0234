We propose some easily implementable solutions for the unclear details of the original paper, such as trapezoid approximation of membership functions, rule creation from sample data points, and selection of important variables. Improvements and critique on Sugeno's and Yasukawa's qualitative modeling Investigates Sugeno's and Yasukawa's (1993) qualitative fuzzy modeling approach. These details are crucial concerning the method's performance as it is shown in a comparative analysis and helps to improve the accuracy of the built-up model. This improvement reduces the time requirement of the method by up to 16% in our experiments Finally, we propose a possible further rule base
