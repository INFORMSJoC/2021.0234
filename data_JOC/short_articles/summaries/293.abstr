Theoretical and experimental investigations on coherence of traffic noise transmission through an open window into a rectangular room in high-rise buildings A method for theoretically calculating the coherence between sound pressure inside a rectangular room in a high-rise building and that outside the open window of the room is proposed. Based on traffic noise prediction methods, wave theory, and mode coupling theory, the results of this paper enabled one to determine the potentials and limitations of ANC used to reduce such a transmission. The calculated results with the proposed method are generally in good agreement with the experimental results and
