One of the major obstacles in low-voltage DRAM is the degradation of data-retention time due to low signal level at the memory cell, which requires power-consuming refresh operations more frequently. Low-voltage DRAM sensing scheme with offset-cancellation sense amplifier A novel bitline sensing scheme is proposed for low-voltage DRAM to achieve low power dissipation and compatibility with low-voltage CMOS. It also improves die efficiency, because the proposed scheme reduces the number of sense amplifiers by supporting more cells in each sense amplifier. Measurements show that the data-retention time of the proposed scheme at 1.5-V supply voltage is 2.4 times of the
