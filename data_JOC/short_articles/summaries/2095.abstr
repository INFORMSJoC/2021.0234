In particular, we show that the system exhibits three distinct responses: a unique, globally-stable steady-state, large amplitude oscillations, and asymptotically unbounded solutions, with the transition between these states being almost instantaneous. Global stability of the attracting set of an enzyme-catalysed reaction system The essential feature of enzymatic reactions is a nonlinear dependency of reaction rate on metabolite concentration taking the form of saturation kinetics. The subsequent disappearance of limit cycles corresponds to the collapse of the domain of attraction of the attracting set for the system and occurs due to a global bifurcation in the flow, namely, a saddle connection.
