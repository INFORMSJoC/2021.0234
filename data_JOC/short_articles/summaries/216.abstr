Extinction cross sections of realistic raindrops: data-bank established using T-matrix method and nonlinear fitting technique A new computer program is developed based on the T-matrix method to generate a large number of total (extinction) cross sections (TCS) values of the realistic raindrops that are deformed due to a balance of the forces that act on a drop failing under gravity, and were described in shape by Pruppacher and Pitter (1971). These data for various dimensions of the raindrops (mean effective radius from 0 to 3.25 mm), frequencies (10 to 80 GHz), (horizontal and vertical) polarizations, and temperatures (0, 10 and
