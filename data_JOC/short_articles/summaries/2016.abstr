Fully automatic algorithm for region of interest location in camera calibration We present an automatic method for region of interest (ROI) location in camera calibration used in computer vision inspection. Experiments show that this algorithm can help to calibrate the intrinsic parameters of the zoom lens and the camera parameters quickly and automatically An intelligent ROI location algorithm based on the Radon transform is developed to automate the calibration process. Several improvement methods are studied to avoid the algorithm's huge time/space consumption problem. Using this method fully automatic camera calibration is achieved without human interactive ROI specification. The algorithm remains
