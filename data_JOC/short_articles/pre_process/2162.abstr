constructions Boolean Boolean algebras prescribed behaviour concerning depth free product Boolean algebras third ZFC using pcf assuming results ultraproducts also family cardinalities topological density homomorphic images Boolean cardinalities closed subspaces lastly inequalities cardinal invariants mainly d B kappa / < |B| implies B /sup kappa /V Depth B or=log |B|
