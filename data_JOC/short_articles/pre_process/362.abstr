batch-constructing B/sup +/-trees algorithm performance evaluation Efficient construction indexes very important bulk-loading database adding new index existing database enormous volume data paper algorithm batch-constructing B/sup +/-tree widely used index structure database systems main characteristic algorithm simultaneously key values B+-tree page accessing page overhead due accessing same page multiple times results applying B+-tree insertion algorithm repeatedly performance evaluation algorithm terms number disk accesses results number disk accesses excluding relocation process identical number pages belonging B/sup +/-tree Considering relocation process unavoidable preprocessing step batch-constructing B/sup +/-trees algorithm just disk access B+-tree page therefore optimal also performance tendency relation different parameter values simulation Finally performance enhancement effect algorithm using insertions experiments
