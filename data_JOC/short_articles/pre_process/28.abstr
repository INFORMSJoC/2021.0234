Uncertainty bounds use design interval type-2 fuzzy logic systems inner- outer-bound sets type-reduced set interval type-2 fuzzy logic system FLS new mathematical interpretation Karnik-Mendel iterative procedure computing type-reduced set bound sets not only estimates uncertainty output interval type-2 FLS also interval type-2 FLS means simulation experiment resulting system type-reduction similar performance type-reduction Therefore new design method bound sets computation burden interval type-2 FLS operation interval type-2 FLS useful real-time applications
