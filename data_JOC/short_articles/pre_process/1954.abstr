Estimating long-range dependence finite sample properties confidence intervals major issue financial economics behavior asset returns long horizons Various estimators long-range dependence Even asymptotic properties important accuracy using simulated series different lengths R/S analysis fluctuation analysis periodogram regression methods samples Gaussian white noise DFA statistics unanimous winner Unfortunately asymptotic distribution theory statistics so far able however empirical ie approximate confidence intervals methods obtained values largely heuristic values authors R/S statistics very close asymptotic values periodogram regression method
