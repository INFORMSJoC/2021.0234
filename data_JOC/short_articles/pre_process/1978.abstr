image representation application image compression main contribution work new paradigm image representation image compression new multilayered representation technique images image superposition coherent layers smooth regions layer layer multilayered decomposition algorithm cascade compressions successively image residuals previous compressions iteration algorithm residual part lossy way only significant structures residual part results sparse representation layer independently different transform basis different bitrate combination compressed layers always meaningful way strength multilayer approach fact different sets basis functions others basis functions reasonable account large trend data others local transients oscillatory patterns multilayered representation lot beautiful applications image understanding image video coding algorithm capabilities
