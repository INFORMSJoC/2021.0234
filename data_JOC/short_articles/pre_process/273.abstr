Chemical information scaling molecular descriptors universal chemical scale library design analysis Scaling difficult issue analysis chemical properties molecular topology disparate descriptors properties different data sets common scale Using several publicly available databases ACD CMC MDDR NCI basis chemically meaningful scales number molecular properties topology descriptors chemically scaling functions several advantages First possible chemically relevant scales greatly simplifying similarity diversity analyses data sets Second approach convenient method setting descriptor boundaries chemically reasonable topology spaces example descriptors so little potential biological activity bioavailability other drug-like characteristics easily outliers scaling values molecular descriptors addition percentile values descriptor use outlier filtering
