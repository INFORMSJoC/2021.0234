Matching PET CT scans head neck area Development method validation Positron emission tomography PET important information tumor biology detailed anatomical information aim present study automatic registration method matching PET CT scans head neck difficulties achieving goal nonrigid motions neck use automatic body transformations emission scans too little anatomical information standard image fusion methods objective way quality match results problems accurate reproducible positioning patient using radiotherapy treatment mask proposed method use transmission rather emission scan sufficient anatomical information matching bed positions transmission scan protocol mutual information-based algorithm registration technique PET CT data patients patient CT scans PET scan datasets consistency matching PET CT/sub CT/sub CT/sub CT/sub PET using full circle consistency test using method consistency mm degrees average PET voxels registration mm errors quite favorably voxel size Cropping images removing scanner bed images not consistency algorithm transmission scan however potentially single position using approach conclusion algorithm validation technique several features attractive theoretical practical point view user-independent automatic validation technique matching CT PET scans head neck opportunity different image enhancements
