Optical encoding color three-dimensional correlation Three-dimensional correlation color images considering color distribution third dimension useful color pattern recognition tasks Nevertheless correlation not directly optical correlator only two-dimensional signals method functions ones such way Fourier transform correlation signals optically Fourier transform correlation signals theory encoding experimental results optical correlator
