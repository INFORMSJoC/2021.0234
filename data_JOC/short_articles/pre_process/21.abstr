Discrete output feedback sliding mode control second order systems moving switching line sliding mode control systems SMCS switching variable independent initial conditions sensitive variations extraneous disturbances reaching phase second order systems drawback using moving switching line technique switching line initially initial conditions subsequently towards predetermined switching line paper use above idea moving switching line together reaching law approach discrete output feedback sliding mode control main contributions work such not system states use only output samples designing controller using moving switching line low sensitivity system shortening reaching phase Simulation results fast output sampling feedback guarantees sliding motion similar using state feedback
