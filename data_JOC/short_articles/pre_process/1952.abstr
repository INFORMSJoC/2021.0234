Comprehensive encoding decoupling solution problems decoherence design solid-state quantum computing Proposals scalable quantum computing devices not only decoherence due interaction environment also severe engineering constraints Here practical solution major concerns addressing solid-state proposals particular Decoherence first encoding logical qubit qubits then completely efficient set decoupling pulse sequences same encoding need single-qubit operations difficult design constraint dominant decoherence processes empirically order decoupling pulses
