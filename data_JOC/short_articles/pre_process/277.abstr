Improving predicting power partial order QSARs linear extensions Partial order theory POT attractive operationally simple method ordering compounds structural and/or electronic descriptors order end points eg solubility experimental order modeled order experimental order not experimentally position model eventually prediction end-point value However application POT quantitative structure-activity relationship modeling only compounds directly comparable noninvestigated compounds possibilities improving methodology theory application so-called linear extensions model order study show partial ordering linear extensions promising tool providing probability distribution curves range possible end-point values compounds not being experimentally
