Multiple model adaptive estimation filter spawning Multiple model adaptive estimation MMAE filter spawning partial actuator failures VISTA F-16 truth model full six-degree-of-freedom simulation Calspan General Dynamics design models 13-state linearized models including first order actuator models Actuator failures truth model design model assuming failure free stream Filter spawning additional filters partial actuator failure MMAE bank spawned filters varying degrees partial failures terms effectiveness complete-actuaton-failure hypothesis conditional probability correctness current time Thus blended estimate failure effectiveness using filters' estimates no-failure hypothesis complete actuator failure hypothesis spawned filters partial-failure hypotheses substantial precision effectiveness estimation possible spawning additional filters making partial failure adaptation viable methodology
