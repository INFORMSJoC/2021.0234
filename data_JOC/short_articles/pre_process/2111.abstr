depth-of-focus imaging chlorophyll fluorescence intact leaves Imaging dynamic changes chlorophyll fluorescence valuable means localised changes photosynthetic function Microscope-based systems excellent spatial resolution response individual cells However such systems depth focus leaves inherently uneven only small proportion image focal plane focus report development algorithms specifically imaging chlorophyll fluorescence photosynthetic function living plant cells extended-focus images images different focal planes procedures images chlorophyll fluorescence photosynthetic parameters as well producing map leaf topology robustness procedure using leaves number different plant species
