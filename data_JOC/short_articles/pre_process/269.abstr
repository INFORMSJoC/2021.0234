Genetic algorithm selection variable selection selection A novel genetic algorithm selection method GAS method simple encoding scheme compounds variables QSAR/QSPR model A genetic algorithm then utilized simultaneously encoded variables descriptors compound subsets GAS method multiple models applying subset compounds Typically subsets clusters different chemotypes Also procedure molecular similarity model test compound variable selection method GAS using Selwood data set n compounds descriptors results method comparable other methods subset selection method GAS first using artificial data set n = points descriptor ability data points second XLOGP data set n = descriptors method able artificial data points belonging various subsets analysis XLOGP data set subset selection method useful improving QSAR/QSPR model variable selection method fails
