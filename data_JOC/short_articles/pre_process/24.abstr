Fuzzy modeling generalized conjunction operations approach modeling tuning parametric conjunction operations First methods construction parametric generalized conjunction operations parametric classes conjunctions Second several examples function approximation fuzzy models tuning parameters new conjunction operations approximation performances approaches tuning membership functions other approaches literature tuning conjunction operations obtaining fuzzy models sufficiently good performance tuning membership functions not possible not desirable
